How this is actually going to work:


* ('/login') 'home' displays the start menu with user Auth

  - LINK filling out auth and submitting will POST to DATABASE and bring you to hbs('/user')


* ('/user') displays user information, past scores, and character stats from database.
    + When you select a character to play, your user-id gets attached to that characters foreign-key and becomes one of your characters)
  - LINK to character selection hbs('/character_selection')


* (/character_selection) all characters from the database will be displayed with their stats.
    + possible: "Continue with your character.." option.
    **** How do see if multiple players are online at the moment? This is where two-player game would be selected? ****
  - LINK to start game hbs('/start')

* (/start)

  - Game init:

    + TOP {
        The game map is loaded:
          The player(s) images are placed at the starting position(s).
            + possible: IF the map is the same for every game (if this is only one
              map and not a randomly generated one), then the path will never change,
              therefore the each tile can be a simple <div id="#?"> and player images
              can fade-in/fade-out along the board as they move.

          + possible: Tile faces display either blank or enemy/power-up locations
      }

    + Bottom {

      LEFT: The character stats are displayed.
      CENTER: The mini-game window is drawn using css canvas.
      RIGHT: Blank / Enemy-stats / Power-up

    }

- First roll:

  + Each character is given an initial roll to see who starts.

MAIN FUNCTION() {

  + Check if player has reached the FINISH

    IF player has reached the finish {

    - display END GAME Graphics

      IF (REPLAY Feature) 

      - POST updated character stats to user info in db

    }

  + possible: IF the tile faces are displayed with enemy/power-up locations
  the availability of multiple roll options ex. (3,5,1) would easily give
  an added level of strategy to the game.

  ***** Where is this main function handled? (start.hbs) <script>? *****

  + Roll is generated and character progresses

  + Character image is moved along the map according to roll number

    IF POWER-UP is located at that tile:

      + (event handler) pop-up window || BOTTOM-RIGHT to display item:

        Display POWER-UP type.
        Display POWER-UP strength, ex: (12, 24, 36).
        Display option to SMASH.

    IF ENEMY is located on that tile: {

      + (event handler)

        - BOTTOM-RIGHT to display ENEMY stats:

        - BOTTOM-CENTER initiate css canvas {
          + display character image
          + display enemy image
        }


        ****** When are these stats generated? ******
        *
        * All enemy stats are generated initially on (/start) for all enemies on
        * the board and saved in an object (most sense?).
        *
        * || All enemy stats are generated for each character playing individually
        * and saved individually (redundant?).
        *
        * || In the event of an enemy battle $.post is used call db
        * (least efficient?).
        *
        *********************************************

        Display ENEMY name.
        Display ENEMY image.
        Display ENEMY health.

      + First roll

        - decides who strikes first.

      + Attack

        - Health points are lost when (Enemy Attack Power points - Character Defense points)
        - Fighting continues until either Player dies or Enemy dies

        IF character HEALTH = 0

          + Game Over

          + Player 2 wins

            character stat growth feature, will there be a bonus
            for player 1 outliving player 2 || (vise versa)

        IF Player WIN

          + Player HEALTH  += (ENEMY HEALTH * .25)

          IF SOLO PLAY design

            + Init next roll/iteration MAIN FUNCTION().

          IF !SOLO PLAY
            + Init next player roll
            ****** How do we handle computer enemy fight? Possible roll based
              ex: (highest roll strikes, repeat)

              - possible: SKIP feature until for computer characters.
